    "# 6. Hyperparameter tuning\n",
    "An important task in Machie Learning is model selection, or using data to find the best model or parameters for a given task. This is also called tuning. Tuning may be done for individual Estimators such as LinearRegression, or for entire Pipelines which include multiple algorithms, featurization, and other steps. Users can tune an entire Pipeline at once, rather than tuning each element in the Pipeline separately. MLlib supports model selection tools, such as `CrossValidator`. These tools require the following items:\n",
    "* Estimator: algorithm or Pipeline to tune (`setEstimator`)\n",
    "* Set of ParamMaps: parameters to choose from, sometimes called a \"parameter grid\" to search over (`setEstimatorParamMaps`)\n",
    "* Evaluator: metric to measure how well a fitted Model does on held-out test data (`setEvaluator`)\n",
    "\n",
    "`CrossValidator` begins by splitting the dataset into a set of folds, which are used as separate training and test datasets. For example with `k=3` folds, `CrossValidator` will generate 3 (training, test) dataset pairs, each of which uses 2/3 of the data for training and 1/3 for testing. To evaluate a particular `ParamMap`, `CrossValidator` computes the average evaluation metric for the 3 Models produced by fitting the Estimator on the 3 different (training, test) dataset pairs. After identifying the best `ParamMap`, `CrossValidator` finally re-fits the Estimator using the best ParamMap and the entire dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, use the `CrossValidator` to select the best Random Forest model. To do so, you need to define a grid of parameters. Let's say we want to do the search among the different number of trees (1, 5, and 10), and different tree depth (5, 10, and 15)."
